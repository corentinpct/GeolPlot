# GeolPlot User Guide

------------------------------------------------------------------------
GeolPlot allows users to __import `.csv` files__ from [FieldMOVE Clino](https://www.petex.com/products/move-suite/digital-field-mapping/) projects, to __harmonize__ data and __generate multiple stereographic representations in a row__ based on user choices.

The following document aims to provide a __basic and comprehensive overview__ of GeolPlot. Each feature within the program is associated with examples from synthetic data sets (can be founded in the [examples](http://github.com/corentinpct/GeolPlot/blob/main/examples) section of the repository).

- [Rename specific parameters from imported file(s)](#rename-specific-parameters-from-imported-files)

 - [Generate stereographic representations from imported data](#generate-stereographic-representations-from-imported-data)

## Import and add file(s) into GeolPlot
Once GeolPlot is launched, the user will be prompted to import data from __one or multiple CSV or Excel files__ to start the application.

__In the `File` tab, select `Import` then `Import CSV file(s)` or `Import Excel file(s)`__

![import](https://github.com/corentinpct/GeolPlot/assets/133667270/44157190-feb1-4b4c-a6f2-f71cee202ea9)

A dialog window will open, allowing you to __choose one or more CSV files (in this case) from FieldMOVE Clino__.
__No modifications should be made to the files exported from the mobile application__, as they must strictly adhere to the initial format of the CSV file generated by FieldMOVE Clino.

Once the files are imported, GeolPlot will appear as follows. The user can __navigate through the currently imported files and their parameters__ and __select data they wish to represent__ later.

![import](https://github.com/corentinpct/GeolPlot/assets/133667270/cf0e41c8-1095-4200-8af9-fd23ba4f489a)
_Here, we have imported `sample1.csv` and `sample2.csv`_.

GeolPlot allows, at any point before generation, to __import additional file(s)__ without needing to import the previously imported files again.

__In the `File` tab, select `Add data on current data` then `From CSV file(s)` or `From Excel file(s)`__ to open the file selection dialog window.

![add](https://github.com/corentinpct/GeolPlot/assets/133667270/a2f2d076-6280-44af-bc30-79217f3fd822)

Once the additional file(s) imported, the upper-left part of the window and the content of the lower-left window will be updated.

![add](https://github.com/corentinpct/GeolPlot/assets/133667270/f71b2767-5d1e-4ea5-985e-c24858e6d682)
_Here, we have selected `sample3.csv` and `sample4.csv` as additional files._

## Rename specific parameters from imported file(s)

GeolPlot offers an option to __harmonize the parameters identified (`Locality`, `Unit`, `Plane type`)__ in the imported files __if these parameters have been defined heterogeneously__ across FieldMOVE Clino projects. 

__In the `Data` tab, select `Set name(s) for` then select select the parameter you want to change__.

![rename](https://github.com/corentinpct/GeolPlot/assets/133667270/a779fa4f-18fa-4209-9e46-101b6617812d)
_In this synthetic dataset, `UnitA` and `StrataA` relate to the same geological unit. Similarly for the pair `UnitB` and `StrataB` and the pair `UnitC` and `StrataC`_.

This will open the following dialog window (__spaces will be removed from the name entered__ in this window to reduce errors related to stereonet generation).

![setA](https://github.com/corentinpct/GeolPlot/assets/133667270/b257bdc2-c84a-474e-bb5e-6c71e2850653)
_Here, we rename `StrataA` to `Unit A` to harmonize the data across all imported files_.

![rename](https://github.com/corentinpct/GeolPlot/assets/133667270/567bf399-17fa-458d-9e9c-8a7e7e306d05)
_After repeating this process for the remaining pairs, the harmonized geological units are `UnitA`, `UnitB`, `UnitC` and `UnitD`._

## Save current data as a CSV or Excel file
`GeolPlot` allows the user to save imported data as `.xslx` or `.csv`. This feature allows obtaining a __more readable file format__ than the one proposed by FieldMOVE Clino, as well as __concatenating data from multiple imported CSV files in a single file__. Saving the data __also applies the modifications made in `GeolPlot`__ to the original data and produces a __single harmonized file__.

__In the `File` tab, select `Save current data as` then select the desired extension__ to open a dialog window. 

![save](https://github.com/corentinpct/GeolPlot/assets/133667270/c4505528-fc51-4c72-b6f5-ec8879815bbe)
_Here, we have saved the data in the file `mergedsamples.xlsx` findable in [examples](http://github.com/corentinpct/GeolPlot/blob/main/examples)._

## Generate stereographic representations from imported data
Here, the user should define __at least a locality, a unit, a plane type, an orientation and an output directory__ to initiate stereographic representation. The __available methods for plotting density contouring__ are the methods provided in the __mplstereonet package__ (for any information regarding stereographic representation, consider visiting the [mplstereonet GitHub repository](https://github.com/joferkington/mplstereonet#density-contouring)).

![generate](https://github.com/corentinpct/GeolPlot/assets/133667270/d6c11284-4a8d-43f9-8074-6c5d62626a3d)
_Here, we have selected all parameters form imported files and each representation settings to represent data from the synthetic dataset_.

As soon as the user wants to initiate the generation, they just need to __click on `Generate` at the bottom right__.
